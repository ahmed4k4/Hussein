            <h2>Glass Sycori </h2>
            <p>
            Sycorite glass is processed by heating it to a temperature of 680 degrees Celsius and then rapidly cooling it,
            We specialize in high-quality Sycorite glass works ranging from 5 mm to 20 mm thickness.
            Sycorite glass shatters into small, harmless pieces upon impact, making it safer for use in various applications.
            giving it exceptional strength to withstand impacts, high temperatures, and other factors. Unlike regular glass,
            Uses of Sycorite Glass:
